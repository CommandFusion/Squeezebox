# Squeezebox Control via CommandFusion 

This project allows for control of Squeezebox units via Ethernet using CommandFusion software.
http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/SlimProto_TCP_protocol

The project is split into 2 parts:

1. [iViewer JavaScript file](#js)
1. [CF iViewer Project](#iviewer)

### <a name="js" />iViewer JavaScript File
We have developed a JavaScript file for iViewer that handles all the Ethernet communication with Squeezebox.

### <a name="iviewer" />CF iViewer Project
To go along with the [JavaScript file](#js), we have created a sample iViewer project.  
This project should be used as a reference on how to call the JavaScript functions in your own project and how to setup the System Properties.
